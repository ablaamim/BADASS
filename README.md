# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to expand on the knowledge you have gained through NetPractice. You will have to simulate a network and configure it using GNS3 with docker
images .
BGP EVPN is based on BGP (RFC 4271) and its extensions MP-BGP (RFC4760).
BGP is the routing protocol that drives the Internet. Through MP-BGP extensions, it
can be used to carry reachability information (NLRI) for various protocols (IPv4, IPv6,

It is divided into three parts you have to do in the following order:
• Part 1: GNS3 configuration with Docker.
• Part 2: Discovering a VXLAN.
